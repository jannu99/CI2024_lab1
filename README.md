I use to algorithms, basic hill climbing when the dimension of the problem are relatively small and simulated annealing for the larger instances.
The program can be optimize tuning the hyperparameters like temperature, cooling rate, penalty for uncovered items, intial solution and using different change rates in tweak functions.
Also, for the larger instances a bigger number of step will be needed for the solution to converge (the computation will last a big amount of time).
